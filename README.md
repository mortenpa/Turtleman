# Turtleman
Turtleman is a customer management service. 
The project name is not a reference to the slowness of the turtle but rather draws its inspiration from the protective shell of its namesake.
Turtleman protects your customer data like a turtle's protective shell.
It will start the journey with your customer data and cross the finish line with your customer data safe and secure!

# How to run Turtleman
¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

# Technologies and design
Turtleman uses Java 17 alongside Spring for that modern touch of enterprise code. 

The H2 in-memory database keeps the data access lightning fast. Just don't turn off the server!

If you do need to start or restart the server, Liquibase provides schema migrations so that everything will be up and running without additional tinkering.

Read up on our RESTful service in the attached Swagger documentation.
